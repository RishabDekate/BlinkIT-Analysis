# Recommendations:

Based on the insights, following recommendations have been provided:
- As total sales is $1.20M which have most customers from tier 3 regions so if we focus little more on tier 1 & 2 regions, we can increase total sales more.
- We can increase profits by getting users attention by putting sale on products and giving some coupons on purschase they do. To increase reach of the app we can also advertise our app on television, so that more users in different tiers know about the app.
- So when the users will increase then we will require more established outlets for product sales, that can be big small or medium based on the vendors choice. This will increse our reach to rest tier 1 & 2 users and profits which we can utilize for improving our app more.
